title={An Overview of Overfitting and its Solutions},
journal={Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract={Overfitting is a fundamental issue in supervised machine learning which prevents us from perfectly generalizing the models to well fit observed data on training data, as well as unseen data on testing set. Because of the presence of noise, the limited size of training set, and the complexity of classifiers, overfitting happens. This paper is going to talk about overfitting from the perspectives of causes and solutions. To reduce the effects of overfitting, various strategies are proposed to address to these causes: 1) ‚Äúearly-stopping‚Äù strategy is introduced to prevent overfitting by stopping training before the performance stops optimize; 2) ‚Äúnetwork-reduction‚Äù strategy is used to exclude the noises in training set; 3) ‚Äúdata-expansion‚Äù strategy is proposed for complicated models to fine-tune the hyper-parameters sets with a great amount of data; and 4) ‚Äúregularization‚Äù strategy is proposed to guarantee models performance to a great extent while dealing with real world issues by feature-selection, and by distinguishing more useful and less useful features.}

ABSTRACT = {Mixture distributions arise in many parametric and non-parametric settings‚Äîfor example, in Gaussian mixture models and in non-parametric estimation. It is often necessary to compute the entropy of a mixture, but, in most cases, this quantity has no closed-form expression, making some form of approximation necessary. We propose a family of estimators based on a pairwise distance function between mixture components, and show that this estimator class has many attractive properties. For many distributions of interest, the proposed estimators are efficient to compute, differentiable in the mixture parameters, and become exact when the mixture components are clustered. We prove this family includes lower and upper bounds on the mixture entropy. The Chernoff Œ± -divergence gives a lower bound when chosen as the distance function, with the Bhattacharyaa distance providing the tightest lower bound for components that are symmetric and members of a location family. The Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence gives an upper bound when used as the distance function. We provide closed-form expressions of these bounds for mixtures of Gaussians, and discuss their applications to the estimation of mutual information. We then demonstrate that our bounds are significantly tighter than well-known existing bounds using numeric simulations. This estimator class is very useful in optimization problems involving maximization/minimization of entropy and mutual information, such as MaxEnt and rate distortion problems.},

  abstract =   {Mutual information (MI) minimization has gained considerable interests in various machine learning tasks. However, estimating and minimizing MI in high-dimensional spaces remains a challenging problem, especially when only samples, rather than distribution forms, are accessible. Previous works mainly focus on MI lower bound approximation, which is not applicable to MI minimization problems. In this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Log-ratio Upper Bound (CLUB) of mutual information. We provide a theoretical analysis of the properties of CLUB and its variational approximation. Based on this upper bound, we introduce a MI minimization training scheme and further accelerate it with a negative sampling strategy. Simulation studies on Gaussian distributions show the reliable estimation ability of CLUB. Real-world MI minimization experiments, including domain adaptation and information bottleneck, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is at https://github.com/Linear95/CLUB.}
