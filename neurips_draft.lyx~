\begin_layout Title
A Tighter Bound on the Information Bottleneck with Applications to Deep
 Learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The Information Bottleneck (IB) provides a hypothetically optimal framework
 for data modeling, yet is often intractable.
 Recent efforts optimized supervised DNNs with a variational upper bound
 to the IB objective, resulting in improved robustness to adversarial attacks.
 However, when deriving the upper bound, the supervisor distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{*}(y)$
\end_inset

 is assumed to be constant, where in practice it is optimized over.
 This work demonstrates that lifting this assumption not only results in
 a tighter bound on the IB and improved empirical performance, but also
 proposes a new motivation for conditional entropy regularization.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Deep Neural Nets (DNNs) learn latent representations induced by their downstream
 task, objective function, and other parameters.
 The quality of the learned representations impacts the DNN's generalization
 ability and the coherence of the emerging latent space 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{Bengio2009}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A question emerges regarding the extraction of an optimal latent representation
 for all data points, from a restricted set of training examples.
 Classic information theory provides rate-distortion 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{Shannon1959}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for optimal compression of data.
 However, rate-distortion regards all information as equal, not taking into
 account which information is more relevant to a specified downstream task,
 without constructing tailored distortion functions.
 The Information Bottleneck (IB) 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{Tishby1999}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 resolves this limitation by defining mutual information (MI) between the
 learned representation and a designated downstream task as a universal
 distortion function.
 Yet, learning representations using the IB method is possible given discrete
 distributions, and some continuous ones, but not in the general case 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{Chechik2003}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, MI is either difficult or impossible to optimize over when considerin
g deterministic models, such as MLPs 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{Saxe2018,Amjad2020}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Nonetheless, the promise of the IB remains alluring, and recents works
 utilized VAE 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 inspired variational approximations to approximate upper bounds to the
 IB objective, allowing its utilization as a loss function for DNNs, where
 the underlying distributions are both continuous and unknown 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{Alemi2017,Fischer2020,Cheng2020}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 These approaches learn representations in supervised settings, without
 knowledge of the underlying distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{*}(x,y)$
\end_inset

, utilizing the learned variational conditional 
\begin_inset Formula $p(y|x)$
\end_inset

 to approximate MI.
 In contrast, non variational IB methods learn representations in unsupervised
 settings, where the stochastic process underlying the observed data is
 known 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{Tishby1999,Chechik2003,Painsky2017}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Nonetheless, when deriving the variational IB objectives, previous research
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{Alemi2017,Fischer2020,Cheng2020}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 relax the problem by considering the learned representation as the only
 optimized parameter, when in practice the classifier is also optimized.
 We derive a new upper bound for the IB objective, and a subsequent variational
 approximation, by removing this relaxation.
 We show that our bound is tighter than previous bounds, and that our proposed
 loss function is a tighter variational approximation, when considering
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(y|x)$
\end_inset

 as part of the optimization.
 We believe our new derivation is a better adaptation of the IB for supervised
 tasks, and show empirical evidence of improved performance across several
 challenging tasks over different modalities.
 We utilize previous studies on variational representation learning and
 regularization 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{Alemi2018,Pereyra2017,Achille2018}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to interpret our findings, and conclude that our proposed derivation applies
 regularization over the variational classifier, preventing it from overfitting
 the learned representations, thus enabling greater MI between learned represent
ation and target 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.

 to mitigate signal loss during compression: A source

\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

, such that maximal compression is achieved while keeping the encoding quality
 above a certain threshold.
 Encoding quality is measured by a task specific distortion function:

 Rate-distortion suggests a mapping that minimizes the rate of bits to source

 The Information Bottleneck (IB)

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 extends rate-distortion by replacing the tailored distortion functions
 with MI over a target distribution: Let 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 be the target signal for some specific downstream task, such that the joint
 distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{*}(x,y)$
\end_inset

 is known, and define the distortion function as MI between 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 The IB is the solution to the optimization problem 
\begin_inset Formula $Z:\underset{P(z|x)}{min}I(X;Z)$
\end_inset

 subject to 
\begin_inset Formula $I(Z;Y)\ge D$
\end_inset

, that can be optimized by minimizing the IB objective 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{IB}=I(X;Z)-\beta I(Z;Y)$
\end_inset

 over 
\begin_inset Formula $P(z|x)$
\end_inset

.
 The solution to this objective is a function of the Lagrange multiplier
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, and is a theoretical limit for representation quality, given mutual informatio
n as an accepted metric, as elaborated in more detail in Appendix

 approximation for an upper bound to the IB objective for DNN optimization.
 Bounds for 
\begin_inset Formula $I(X,Z)$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I(Z,Y)$
\end_inset

 are derived from the non negativity of KL divergence, and are used to form
 an upper bound for the IB objective.
 A variational upper bound is derived by replacing intractable distributions
 with variational approximations.

 proposed an IB based loss function named Conditional Entropy Bottleneck
 (CEB), in which the conditional mutual information of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 given 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is minimized, instead of the unconditional mutual information.
 The CEB loss, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{CEB}=\underset{Z}{min}I(X;Z|Y)-\gamma I(Y;Z)$
\end_inset

, is designed to minimize all information in 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 that is not relevant to the downstream task 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

, by conditioning over 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 CEB is equivalent to IB for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\beta-1$
\end_inset

 following the chain rule of mutual information 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{Cover1999elements}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and the IB Markov chain, as established in Appendix
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

B.
 Similarly to VIB, a variational approximation for CEB was proposed as 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{VCEB}=\mathbb{E}_{x,y}log\left(e(z|x)\right)-\mathbb{E}_{x,y}log\left(b(z|y)\right)-\gamma\mathbb{E}_{x,y}log\left(c(y|z)\right)$

 the variational expression

\end_inset

 investigated wether VCEB is a tighter variational approximation to IB than
 VIB, and concluded that no ordering can be established in the general case,
 noting that any empirical improvement VCEB exhibits over VIB is not due
 to a tighter variational bound on the IB, but rather of VCEB being more
 amenable to optimization, or simply a successful loss function in its own
 regard.

 settings, measuring distortion as MI between input and reconstructed images,
 and rate as KL divergence between variational representation and marginal.
 The limits of representation quality in VAEs are looser than the theoretical
 IB limits, and heavily depend on the chosen variational families of the
 marginal and decoder distributions.
 The closer the families are to the true distributions, the tighter the
 gap to the optimal IB limit.
 
\begin_inset ERT

 showed that VAEs are susceptible to learn low quality representations,
 as the KL regularization term in the ELBO loss might induce very uninformative
 representations, provided there's a strong enough decoder to compensate
 for bad embeddings by overfitting them.

 However, adapting IB to supervised tasks admits the learned classifier

 Following this logic, we argue that supervised IB optimization should be

\begin_inset Formula $p^{*}(y),p(\tilde{y})$
\end_inset

.
 We derive a new upper bound for the IB objective by not omitting 
\begin_inset Formula $H(Y)$
\end_inset

 from the distortion term.
 Subsequently, the variational approximation for our proposed bound is tighter,
 when taking into account that the optimization process is done over 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\tilde{y}|z)$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $p(z|x)$
\end_inset

 This modification attains a tighter variational bound on the IB objective
 for any

 increasing the entropy term

C.
 In this modality, VUB significantly outperforms VIB in both test set accuracy
 and robustness to the two attacks.
 Moreover, VUB also outperformed the original model in terms of test set
 accuracy.
 A comparison of the best VIB and VUB models further substantiates these
 findings, with statistical significance confirmed by a p-value of less
 than 0.05 in a Wilcoxon rank sum test.

 In almost all cases VUB attains significantly higher accuracy over unseen
 data, as well as significantly higher robustness to adversarial attacks.
 For this modality, VUB also outperforms the vanilla model in terms of test
 set accuracy for

\begin_layout Standard
The IB is a private case of rate distortion, and was initially designed
 as to optimized compressed representations.
 Adapting the IB objective for supervised tasks results in optimization
 of a classifier distribution as well, and requires a reformulation of the
 initial problem to include both representation and discriminator.
 Following this logic, assuming a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $H(Y)$
\end_inset

 relaxes the problem, and lifting this assumption lead us to derive a tighter
 variational bound over the optimized objective.
 When used as a loss function, our proposed bound produces significantly
 better classification accuracy, with equivalent or superior robustness
 to adversarial attacks, over high dimensional tasks of different modalities,
 with high statistical significance.
 On a practical level, the conditional entropy term that follows from our
 proposed derivation provides strong classifier regularization, as shown
 in 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

.
 This type of regularization is a possible remedy to the imbalances inherit
 in the ELBO loss function, and correlatively to VIB, as described by 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

citet{Alemi2018}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In addition, we propose an possible intuitive motivation for conditional
 entropy regularization, by showing that in the extreme cases high variational
 entropy can squeeze the true mutual information 
\begin_inset Formula $I(Z;Y)$
\end_inset

 higher, implying better representations learned.
 While other advancements have been done in recent years, 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{Fischer2020,Cheng2020}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, they focus on modifications to the IB rate term, and none show a tighter
 bound than VIB.
 In contrast, our work derives a provable upper bound by modifying the distortio
n term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Applying variational IB as an objective to supervised learning relies on
 three assumptions: (1) It suffices to optimize the mutual information metric
 to optimize a model’s performance; (2) Forgetting more information about
 the input, while keeping relevant information about the output, induces
 better generalization; (3) Mutual information between the input, output
 and latent representation can be approximated to a desired level of accuracy.
 Our improved empirical results, induced by a tighter bound, suggest better
 data modeling, and strengthen the cause for variational IB as an objective
 for classifier DNNs.
 A possible counter argument is, that the improvments in adversarial robustness
 of variational IB DNNs is an artifact of their latent geometry, rather
 than the quality of their learned representations.
 As the KL regularization induces a smoother latent spce, minor perturbations
 will not cause a significant change in latent semantics, possibly making
 the models more robust to attacks.
 Nonetheless, VUB is presented as a tractable and tighter upper bound of
 the IB objective, that can be easily adapted to any classifier DNN to significa
ntly increase robustness to various adversarial attacks, while inflicting
 minimal decrease in test set performance, and in some cases even increasing
 it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study opens many opportunities for further research: Further improvements
 to the upper bound, including combining VUB with the CLUB bound on rate

; Applying VUB in self-supervised learning, and in particular to measure
 whether representations learned with VUB capture better semantics than
 representations learned with non IB inspired loss functions; Finally, experimen
ts with a full covariance matrix VUB, and studying the effects of latent
 geometry on adversarial robustness is left to future work.

We denote random variables (RVs) with upper cased letters

 Denote discrete Probability Mass Functions (PMFs) with an upper case 
\begin_inset Formula $P(x)$
\end_inset

 and continuous Probability Density Functions (PDFs) with a lower case

 Subscripts are written where the RVs identities are not clear from the

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X,Y$
\end_inset

 be two observed random variables with a true and unknown joint distribution
 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{*}(x,y)$
\end_inset

, and true marginals 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{*}(x),\,p^{*}(y)$
\end_inset

.
 We can attempt to approximate these distributions using a model 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 with parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, such that for generative tasks 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\theta}(x)\approx p^{*}(x)$
\end_inset

, and for discriminative tasks 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\theta}(y|x)\approx p^{*}(y|x)$
\end_inset

, using a dataset of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 i.i.d observation pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}=\left\{ (x_{1},y_{1}),...,(x_{N},y_{N})\right\} $
\end_inset

 One can also assume the existence of an additional unobserved RV 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\sim p^{*}(z)$
\end_inset

 that influences or generates the observed RVs 
\begin_inset Formula $X,Y$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 is unobserved, it is absent from the dataset 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $p_{\theta}(z)$

\begin_layout Standard
When modeling an unobserved variable of an unknown distribution, we encounter
 a problem as the marginal

 This intractability can be overcome by choosing some tractable parametric

\begin_inset Formula $p_{\theta}(z|x)$

 observe that the variational rate 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 does not depend on the variational decoder distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $d(x|z)$
\end_inset

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is used as the ELBO KL regularizer, high variational compression rates
 can be attained regardless of MI between decoder and learned representation.
 Equivalently, good reconstruction does not directly depend on good representati
on.
 Empirical evidence suggest that VAEs are prone to learn uninformative represent
ations while still acheiving low ELBO loss, a degeneration made possible
 by overpowerful decoders that are able to overfit the little information
 captured by the encoder.
 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{KL}\left(e(z|x)\big|\big|m(z)\right)$
\end_inset

 approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $0$

\begin_inset Formula $e(z|x)\rightarrow m(z)$
\end_inset

, making 
\begin_inset Formula $e(z|x)$
\end_inset

 close to independence from 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, resulting in a latent representation that fails to encode information
 about the input.
 However, a suitably powerful decoder could possibly learn to overfit encoded
 traces of the training examples, and reach a low distortion score during
 optimization.

 proposed a representation-learning interpretation of DNNs using the IB
 framework, regarding DNNs as Markov cascades of intermediate representations
 between hidden layers.
 Under this notion, comparing the optimal and the achieved rate-distortion
 ratios between DNN layers will indicate if a model is too complex or too
 simple for a given task and training set.

 visualized and analyzed the information plane behavior of DNNs over a toy
 problem with a known joint distribution.
 Mutual information of the different layers was estimated and used to analyze
 the training process.
 The learning process over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) exhibited two
 separate and sequential behaviors: A short Empirical Error Minimization
 phase (ERM) characterized by a rapid decrease in distortion, followed by
 a long compression phase with an increase in rate until convergence to
 an optimal IB limit, as demonstrated in Figure

 It was found that double-sided saturated nonlinear activations, such as

 It was also shown that DNN generalization did not depend on a distinct
 compression stage, and that DNNs do forget task irrelevant information,
 but this happens concurrently to the learning of task relevant information,
 and not necessarily seperately.

 argued against the use of the IB as an objective for deterministic DNNs,
 as mutual information in deterministic DNNs is either infinite or step
 like, because of mutual information's invariance to invertible transformations,
 and because of the absence of a decision function in the objective.
 Using IB as an objective in stochastic DNNs, such as of the variational
 IB family, is suggested as a possible solution.

.
 For each dataset, a competitive pre-trained model (Vanilla model) was evaluated
 and then used to encode embeddings.
 These embeddings were then used as a dataset for a new stochastic classifier
 net with either a VIB or a VUB loss function.
 Stochastic classifiers consisted of two ReLU activated linear layers of
 the same dimensions as the pre-trained model's logits (2048 for image and
 768 for text classification), followed by reparameterization and a final
 softmax activated FC layer.
 Learning rate was 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-4}$
\end_inset

 and decaying exponentially with a factor of 0.97 every two epochs.
 Batch sizes were 32 for ImageNet and 16 for IMDB.
 All models were trained using an Nvidia RTX3080 GPU with approximately
 1-2 days per a single experiment run.
 Beta values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=10^{-i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\{1,2,3\}$
\end_inset

 were tested, and we used a single forward pass per sample for inference,
 since previous studies indicated that these are the best range and sample
 rate for VIB 
\begin_inset ERT

 Each model was trained and evaluated 5 times per

\end_inset

 value, with consistent performance.
 Statistical significance was demonstrated in all comparisons using the
 Wilcoxon rank sum test with all metrics compared attaining a p-value of
 less than 
\begin_inset Formula $0.05$
\end_inset

.
 Rank sum was computed as follows: A sorted vector of results was prepared
 for each compared metric, where each entry featured the attained result
 in each of the 5 i.i.d.
 experiments per algorithm, and a boolean indicator value for the algorithm
 type.
 For example, let 
\begin_inset Formula $r:=\left((0.94,1)\ (0.935,1)\ (0.93,1)\ (0.93,1)\ (0.925,1)\ (0.92,0)\ (0.915,0)\ (0.915,0)\ (0.91,0)\ (0.89,0)\right)$
\end_inset

 be a sorted vector of (test accuracy, algorithm) tuples, 1 being VUB, 0
 VIB.
 We compute the rank-sum as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu_{T}=\frac{5\cdot11}{2}=27.5,\ \sigma_{T}=\sqrt{\frac{5\cdot5\cdot11}{12}}≈4.78,\ Z(T)=\frac{15-27.5}{4.78}≈-2.61

 InceptionV3 yields a slightly worse single shot accuracy than inceptionV2

bf Claims}     
\backslash
item[] Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction
 accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?     
\backslash
item[] Answer: 
\backslash
answerYes{}     
\backslash
item[] Justification: We believe our abstract and intro are well aligned
 with the main body of the paper.
      
\backslash
item[] Guidelines:     
\backslash
begin{itemize}         
\backslash
item The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include
 the claims made in the paper.
         
\backslash
item The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made,
 including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions
 and limitations.
 A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
          
\backslash
item The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results,
 and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other
 settings.
          
\backslash
item It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it
 is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

\backslash
bf Limitations}     
\backslash
item[] Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed
 by the authors?     
\backslash
item[] Answer: 
\backslash
answerYes{}     
\backslash
item[] Justification: We clearly state experiments where we do not outperform
 previous work in Section 
\backslash
ref{sec:Experiments}, and provide alterative hypothesis for our claim for
 better generalization, and define the assumptions underlying our claim,
 in Section 
\backslash
ref{sec:Discussion}.
     
\backslash
item[] Guidelines:     
\backslash
begin{itemize}         
\backslash
item The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer
 No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in
 the paper.
          
\backslash
item The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section
 in their paper.
         
\backslash
item The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the
 results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions,
 noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations
 only holding locally).
 The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in
 practice and what the implications would be.
         
\backslash
item The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if
 the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs.
 In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which
 should be articulated.
         
\backslash
item The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance
 of the approach.
 For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image
 resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting.
 Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed
 captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
         
\backslash
item The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed
 algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
         
\backslash
item If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their
 approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
         
\backslash
item While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations
 might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might
 be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the
 paper.
 The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual
 actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms
 that preserve the integrity of the community.
 Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning
 limitations.

bf Theory Assumptions and Proofs}     
\backslash
item[] Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the
 full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?     
\backslash
item[] Answer: 
\backslash
answerYes{}     
\backslash
item[] Justification: We provide a clear proof for our claim of a tighter
 bound on the IB objective in Section 
\backslash
ref{sec:vub}, and accompany it with a rigorous analysis of prior work both
 in Section 
\backslash
ref{sec:related_work}, and in Appendix B.
     
\backslash
item[] Guidelines:     
\backslash
begin{itemize}         
\backslash
item The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
          
\backslash
item All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered
 and cross-referenced.
         
\backslash
item All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement
 of any theorems.
         
\backslash
item The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental
 material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors
 are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
          
\backslash
item Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should
 be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
         
\backslash
item Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly reference

\backslash
bf Experimental Result Reproducibility}     
\backslash
item[] Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed
 to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that
 it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless
 of whether the code and data are provided or not)?     
\backslash
item[] Answer: 
\backslash
answerYes{}     
\backslash
item[] Justification: Experiments are provided in full detail in Section 
\backslash
ref{sec:Experiments} and in Appendix C.
 Provided code is easy to run and is well documented.
     
\backslash
item[] Guidelines:     
\backslash
begin{itemize}         
\backslash
item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
         
\backslash
item If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will
 not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is
 important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
         
\backslash
item If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe
 the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
          
\backslash
item Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished
 in various ways.
 For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the
 architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific
 model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible
 for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access
 to the model.
 In general.
 releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproduci
bility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate
 the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language
 model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate
 to the research performed.
         
\backslash
item While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does
 require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility,
 which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
 For example         
\backslash
begin{enumerate}             
\backslash
item If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should
 make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
             
\backslash
item If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper
 should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
             
\backslash
item If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then
 there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results
 or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instruction
s for how to construct the dataset).
             
\backslash
item We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which
 case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for
 reproducibility.
 In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model
 is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible
 for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the
 results.

 with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental
 results, as described in supplemental material?     
\backslash
item[] Answer: 
\backslash
answerYes{}     
\backslash
item[] Justification: The provided code runs easily using a virtual Python
 environmet, with a complete README.md file and in code documentation.
 The datasets used are well known and public datasets.
     
\backslash
item[] Guidelines:     
\backslash
begin{itemize}         
\backslash
item The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring
 code.
         
\backslash
item Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (
\backslash
url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
         
\backslash
item While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that
 this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer.
 Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is
 central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
         
\backslash
item The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed
 to run to reproduce the results.
 See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (
\backslash
url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
         
\backslash
item The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation,
 including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data,
 and generated data, etc.
         
\backslash
item The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results
 for the new proposed method and baselines.
 If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which
 ones are omitted from the script and why.
         
\backslash
item At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release
 anonymized versions (if applicable).
         
\backslash
item Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material
 (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and
 code is permitted.

 (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer,
 etc.) necessary to understand the results?     
\backslash
item[] Answer: 
\backslash
answerYes{}

\backslash
begin{itemize}         
\backslash
item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
         
\backslash
item The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper
 to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make

\backslash
bf Experiment Statistical Significance}     
\backslash
item[] Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly
 defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance
 of the experiments?     
\backslash
item[] Answer: 
\backslash
answerYes{}     
\backslash
item[] Justification: Each experiment was run 5 times with mean and std
 deviation reported in detail.
 Statistical significance was assured using a Wilcoxon rank sum test as
 elaborated in Appendix C.
     
\backslash
item[] Guidelines:     
\backslash
begin{itemize}         
\backslash
item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
         
\backslash
item The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error
 bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least
 for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
         
\backslash
item The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should
 be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random
 drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
         
\backslash
item The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed
 form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)         
\backslash
item The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
         
\backslash
item It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation
 or the standard error of the mean.
         
\backslash
item It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it.
 The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that
 they have a 96
\backslash
% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
         
\backslash
item For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to
 show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results
 that are out of range (e.g.
 negative error rates).
         
\backslash
item If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain
 in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures
 or tables in the text.

item[] Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient
 information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory,
 time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?     
\backslash
item[] Answer: 
\backslash
answerYes{}     
\backslash
item[] Justification: The type of GPU and training time is elaborated in
 Appendix C.
     
\backslash
item[] Guidelines:     
\backslash
begin{itemize}         
\backslash
item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
         
\backslash
item The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal
 cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
         
\backslash
item The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of
 the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
          
\backslash
item The paper should disclose whether the full research project required
 more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary
 or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).

item[] Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every
 respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics 
\backslash
url{https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines}?     
\backslash
item[] Answer: 
\backslash
answerYes{}     
\backslash
item[] Justification: We've reviewed the NeurIPS code of ethics and assured
 our research does not breach it.
     
\backslash
item[] Guidelines:     
\backslash
begin{itemize}         
\backslash
item The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS
 Code of Ethics.
         
\backslash
item If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances
 that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
         
\backslash
item The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is
 a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

\backslash
item {
\backslash
bf Broader Impacts}     
\backslash
item[] Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal
 impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?     
\backslash
item[] Answer: 
\backslash
answerNA{}     
\backslash
item[] Justification: Our research focuses on learning theory and does not
 have any societal impact.
     
\backslash
item[] Guidelines:     
\backslash
begin{itemize}         
\backslash
item The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
         
\backslash
item If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work
 has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
         
\backslash
item Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or
 unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance),
 fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make
 decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations,
 and security considerations.
         
\backslash
item The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research
 and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments.
 However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors
 should point it out.
 For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality
 of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation.
 On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm
 for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that
 generate Deepfakes faster.
         
\backslash
item The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the
 technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that
 could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect
 results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse
 of the technology.
         
\backslash
item If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss
 possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing
 defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms
 to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficienc
y and accessibility of ML).
     
\backslash
end{itemize}      
\backslash
item {
\backslash
bf Safeguards}     
\backslash
item[] Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in
 place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for
 misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?
     
\backslash
item[] Answer: 
\backslash
answerNA{}     
\backslash
item[] Justification: Our paper does not release any proprietary data or
 high risk model.
     
\backslash
item[] Guidelines:     
\backslash
begin{itemize}         
\backslash
item The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
         
\backslash
item Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should
 be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the
 model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or
 restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
          
\backslash
item Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety
 risks.
 The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
         
\backslash
item We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and
 many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this
 into account and make a best faith effort.
